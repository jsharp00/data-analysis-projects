# Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics Dashboard

Power BI dashboard created from the [Tokyo 2020 Olympic Summer Games dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/tokyo-2020-olympics).

The data is first manually imported into an SQL database before being prepared for import into Power BI (see 'Prepared Data.sql'). This imports all the required data into a single table with more readable column names.
